* For current version of this system, to log in as a normal user, user needs 
  to log out from the admin pages, if s/he has logged in as admin.

Manuscripts/Reviewers
----------------------

* The matching decision of Manuscripts/Reviewers will be made by the admin 
  when the "Submit final decision" button was pressed and confirmed.
* After the final decision was made, there is no way to edit it any more.
* Manuscripts with pending matching decisions are listed above all manuscripts 
  whose final descisions have been submitted.
* Removing one current assigned reviewer can be done by unchecking the name 
  after click on the button "Edit".
* The button "Add more reviewers" allows admin adding names which are 
  listed neither in the list of assiged reviewers nor the list of recommend 
  reviewers. 
* To add extra reviewers, click on "Edit" and then "Add more reviewers"; in 
  the right panel, choose the names without a preceeding tick, and click the
  "<" button.
